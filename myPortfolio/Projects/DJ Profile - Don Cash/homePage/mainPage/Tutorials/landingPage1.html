						<p> It’s really helpful to understand beats and bars when learning how to DJ.
					It supports areas of DJing such as identifying the first beat within a bar helping to set up cue points,
					and also counting beats and bars within phrases.

					Having a good ear for music really helps, but anyone can learn to identify bars and phrases. 
					This is especially important for identifying the first beat in a bar or a phrase to help you cue up a 
					song track ready to start to beat match with another song track. </p>

					<div class="sectiontext">
	
						<p> Counting beats is essential to being a great DJ. It’s one of the first things you should learn and understand before 
					starting to mix. Counting beats is actually very simple. The idea is to count your beats in 
					a “One-Two-Three-Four” pattern starting with the first beat of a phrase. Most phrases are 4 bars (16 beats) or 
					8 bars (32 beats), so you’ll be counting in either of those patterns. *Since most dance music is written in 8 bar phrases,
					I will show you what counting beats for an 8 bar pattern looks like. </p>
